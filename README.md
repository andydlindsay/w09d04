# W09D04 Data Structures & Algorithms

### To Do
- [x] Implement a maze generating algorithm

## Algorithm

* Sequence of steps that you perform to get some result

## Data Structures

* A way of storing related data
* Objects
* Arrays

* Tree - Parent nodes, child nodes
* Graph - nodes can be related to multiple other nodes
* Stack - LIFO Last In First Out
* Queue - FIFO First In First Out

## Recursive Backtracking

1. Choose a starting node
2. Push starting node onto stack

While there are nodes in the stack/while stack !empty

3. Find the neighbours of the node

If there are neighbours that have not been visited

4. Randomly make a choice to move
5. Link the new node to the first node
6. Push the new node onto the stack

If there are no neighbours to visit

7. Pop the node off the stack

## Classes

* Player (stretch)
* Board/Maze
* Node
